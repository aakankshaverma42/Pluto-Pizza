# Pluto_pizza
real-time pizza order tracker app using NodeJs, Express and Mongo DB

In this project, I build a real-time online pizza-ordering app using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. By using tailwind CSS for frontend as a CSS framework and EJS template engine as well as socket.io for real-time communication.

We can order a pizza using this app and get real-time notifications about pizza status. In this Project, I cover the following topics: 1. Login system

Cookies and sessions - Use the Database as a session store
Registration
User roles
Shopping cart
real-time pizza status tracker
Real-time web socket private connections
Git
ES6 and SCSS
Express projects unique architecture and many other things.
# Pluto-pizza web app is ready.
